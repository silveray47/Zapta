                <p><span className="zapta">Zapta</span> is here to make your concerts as perfect as can be! Now, since research has shown that 99% of people never read to that point of the "About Us" article, we feel somewhat comfortable just writing shit till this annoying and hypocritical essay will end. Honestly, if you are one of our potential customers and you have reached this point, we kinda feel sorry for you. Moreover, we despise you. You are probably a very insufferable person. We release you from our services and set you free to look for other sites out there. Obviously, you have the characteristic of a party-pooper, might be the type that complains a lot, and we really don't want to spoil the experience of our normal customers with the possibility to be in the same company with you at one of our events. So please F off our website and try your luck somewhere else.</p>
